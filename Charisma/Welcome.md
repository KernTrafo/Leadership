Welcome to our Charisma Training Repository.

You can utilize and modify all the files included here. Please keep in mind the following [licensing terms] (https://github.com/KernTrafo/Leadership/blob/main/LICENCE.md) when using them.

Open-source publications thrive on community participation. We love sharing our concepts and materials with everyone working in similar fields. Moreover, we would be delighted if you also contribute by sharing your content with others. To facilitate this, we have provided two folders in this GitHub repository: one for uploading revised versions of our materials and another for collecting new content, exercises, concepts, and entirely different approaches.

Please remember to include a license notice in your files. Anything you publish here automatically falls under the CC BY 3.0 license, as specified in the licensing terms. Your license notice should appear as follows: CC BY 3.0 - Your Name. This way, other users can easily cite you correctly.

The goal is to collaboratively build a treasure trove of content that we can all access anytime and enhance our work. So, join us and get involved!
